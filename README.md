# Flux0

Building AI-powered applications comes with many challenges. Real-time streaming is essential for seamless interactions, and managing conversations between people and agents requires careful orchestration. Flux0 simplifies this process by providing a streamlined, scalable framework for AI agent deployment, reducing complexity and making AI-driven applications more accessible.

Flux0 enables effortless deployment and management of LangGraph graphs, PydanticAI agents, and other AI workflows. It abstracts the underlying LLM framework, giving you the flexibility to work with different providers without being locked into a specific ecosystem.

Additionally, integrating LLM frameworks into user interfaces can be complex. Flux0 provides flux0-ai/react, a React toolkit that simplifies UI development for LLM-based applications, offering a structured way to handle interactions, event-driven updates, and real-time streaming responses.
